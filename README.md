# Roll Character
## Specification Deliverable
### Elevator Pitch

Roll Charater allows you to virtually roll dice that give you a randomized race, class, alignment, and background! After you've rolled for your character you can choose to reroll or continue forward and roll for stats. Once the stats have been rolled you can name your character and save them.
