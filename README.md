# Roll Character
## Specification Deliverable
### Elevator Pitch
Enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons but not the hassle trying of picking your character? Or maybe you find yourself playing the same kind of character over and over again? Roll Charater allows you to virtually roll dice that give you a randomized race, class, alignment, and background! After you've rolled you can name and save the character or choose to reroll.
