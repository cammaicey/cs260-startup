# Toolchains
- common functional pieces in a web application tool chain
    - **Code repository** - Stores code in a shared, versioned, location.
    - **Linter** - Removes, or warns, of non-idiomatic code usage.
    - **Prettier** - Formats code according to a shared standard.
    - **Transpiler** - Compiles code into a different format. For example, from JSX to JavaScript, TypeScript to JavaScript, or SCSS to CSS.
    - **Polyfill** - Generates backward compatible code for supporting old browser versions that do not support the latest standards.
    - **Bundler** - Packages code into bundles for delivery to the browser. This enables compatibility (for example with ES6 module support), or performance (with lazy loading).
    - **Minifier** - Removes whitespace and renames variables in order to make code smaller and more efficient to deploy.
    - **Testing** - Automated tests at multiple levels to ensure correctness.
    - **Deployment** - Automated packaging and delivery of code from the development environment to the production environment.
- toolchain that we use for our React project
    - GitHub as the code repository
    - Vite for JSX, TS, development and debugging support
    - ESBuild for converting to ES6 modules and transpiling (with Babel underneath)
    - Rollup for bundling and tree shaking
    - PostCSS for CSS transpiling
    - simple bash script (deployReact.sh) for deployment
